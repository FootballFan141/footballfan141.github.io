**Hey everyone**, I am still working on it, was mostly trying to figure out the hourly change feature.
If the next update does not fix this issue, I ask if you have developed Android apps or 
know someone who has, please message me on my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/appsbytravis) to offer advice or assistance or open an issue at the [Github repo](https://github.com/FootballFan141/animal-crossing-music-android-app/issues). Next update will have music from Pocket Camp, but I will be adding music from New Horizons soon.  
  
I need to definitely give credit to the great people at [khinsider.com](https://downloads.khinsider.com/?u=1620063) for providing the mp3 files for the Animal Crossing games. This app wouldn't be possible without them. They provide a great resouce for [Video Game Music](https://downloads.khinsider.com/?u=1620063)!  

Keep having fun with New Horizons!  

Thanks for visiting,  
Travis J.
